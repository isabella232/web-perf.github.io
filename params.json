{"name":"Performance analysis of popular web frameworks","tagline":"","body":"A set of repositories that continuously monitor the performance of some of the popular web frameworks. Runtime performance tests are run whenever a new version of the framework is released. The results from these tests are plotted as graphs to identify abrubt variations or gradual changes in performance characteristics of the frameworks. \r\n\r\n- [Bootstrap](http://web-perf.github.io/bootstrap-perf)\r\n- [React](http://web-perf.github.io/react-perf)\r\n- [Ember](http://web-perf.github.io/ember-perf)\r\n- [Ionic](http://web-perf.github.io/ionic-perf)\r\n\r\n> If you would like to add your framework, [ping me on twitter](http://twitter.com/nparashuram) and I would love to help. If you would like to enhance the test cases, please send pull requests. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
