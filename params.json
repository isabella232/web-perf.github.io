{"name":"Performance of Web Frameworks","tagline":"","body":"> An experiment to discover how performance of web frameworks evolve over versions.\r\n\r\nA set of repositories that continuously monitor the performance of some of the popular web frameworks. Runtime performance tests are run whenever a new version of the framework is released. The results from these tests are plotted as graphs to identify abrubt variations or gradual changes in performance characteristics of the frameworks. \r\n\r\nThe following frameworks are currently tested. \r\n\r\n- [Bootstrap](http://web-perf.github.io/bootstrap-perf)\r\n- [React](http://web-perf.github.io/react-perf)\r\n- [Ember](http://web-perf.github.io/ember-perf)\r\n- [Ionic](http://web-perf.github.io/ionic-perf)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to add your framework, [ping me on twitter](http://twitter.com/nparashuram) and I would love to help. If you would like to enhance the test cases, please send pull requests. ","google":"UA-617499-9","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
